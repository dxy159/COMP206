a)
After running the command "cat Problem1/answer.txt", the standard output read "Permission denied", making the file not accessible to read,

b)
First, I ran the command "chmod u+w Problem1/answer.txt" but permission is still denied. Then I tried "chmod u+r Problem1/answer.txt" and this fixed the error. Below is the content of the file.
This file contains a message with the answer to part 1. The message is:

"Look what I learned in 206!"

Congratulations if you read this.
